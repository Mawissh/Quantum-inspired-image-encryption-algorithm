This paper introduces an innovative quantum image encryption-steganography system that combines a memristor-based Hopfield neural network (mHNN) with an optimal least significant bit (LSB)-based quantum steganography method. The suggested mHNN model addresses the shortcomings of traditional low-dimensional chaotic systems, which frequently exhibit inadequate complexity and diminished randomness. A multi-layer quantum diffusion approach is presented to improve diffusion and bolster resistance against chosen-plaintext attacks. This approach integrates quantum XOR operations utilizing a quantum key picture obtained from a 2D semi-magic matrix, which is produced from randomly chosen layers of a 3D magic cube.  The encryption procedure employs quantum CNOT and CCNOT gates. An optimum LSB-based quantum steganography system is utilized for secure information concealment, significantly mitigating weaknesses linked to fixed-LSB methods while maintaining superior visual quality. Experimental findings indicate robust encryption efficacy, with near-optimal information entropy ($\geq 7.999$) and elevated steganographic inconspicuousness with PSNR values surpassing 54 dB. A thorough comparative assessment further illustrates that the suggested architecture surpasses contemporary state-of-the-art quantum picture encryption and steganography techniques, highlighting its effectiveness and promise for secure quantum image transmission.
